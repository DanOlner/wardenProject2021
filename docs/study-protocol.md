# Introduction

_Background_: A small number of studies have used computer algorithms with areal-level data to detect community borders. One such study by Dean et al. uses a statistical model to detect sharp community boundaries, referred to as social frontiers. However, to date, none of these studies has validated the accuracy of their algorithms externally using human participants or other means. Therefore evidence base for the usefulness of these algorithms for policy and researcher has not developed yet. Data and algorithmic issues could lead to i) misleading inferential results using these borders and ii) misinformation once the results of these algorithms are made available to the public and policy makers.

_Existing literature_: The existence of a boundary between two communities could lead to a number of positive or negative outcomes. Studies using algorithms to detect community boundaries have found that these boundaries are associated with more or less crime/ public disorder. Legewie and Schaeffer [@Legewie] use an edge detection algorithm from image processing whilst Dean et al [@Dean] chose borders based on a Bayesian statistical model. Neither study validated their algorithm and do not describe how they chose most of the tuning parameters in their model.

_Need for a trial_: The need for external validation of the results of algorithms is well accepted in fields like machine learning. Similarly, the validation of measurement instruments well accepted in psychology. The lack of external validation leads to misleading results as well as a range of scientific issues ranging from measurement error to fundamental scientific issues such as a lack of falsifiablity. For example, do detection algorithms pick up 'social frontiers' or are 'social frontiers' the borders picked up by an algorithm. This trial will start to establish an evidence base for the external validity of these detection algorithms.


The experiment is a part of a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews with residents. For the qualitative interview, MZ gave the interview team a map of social frontiers in a city produced earlier in the research project. The team chose an area within each city with an above-average number of social frontiers and began sampling participants local to that area (or were connected to it). The primary goal of the sampling method was to maximise the quality of the qualitative data. This place some limitations on the experimental design.

## Author's contributions

MZ conceived of the study. AP designed the qualitative interviews, sampling design and the recruitment of participants. AP will conduct the interviews. LW and MZ created the research materials for the exercise and the study protocol. LW and MZ are responsible for the write up of the study protocol and results. MZ provides statistical expertise and primary data analysis. AP and GP are grant holders.
